    let largest = Math.max(...nums)

    while(remainder != 0){
        remainder = largest % smallest //we need to keep dividing larger by a smaller numbers until we get to a reminder of 0
        largest = smallest //we set the largest number to the smallest 
        smallest = remainder //we set the largest number to the smallest
        //the last two steps are essential so that when we keep going until the remainder becomes 0 
        for examples: 
two numbers are 48 and 18:
we do 48 % 18 to get 12
we then set the largest to 18 and the smallest to 12 to do the operation again
we do 18 % 12 which equals 6
we then set the largest to 12 and the smallest to 6 to do the operation again
we do 12 % 6 which equals 0
we set largest to 6 and smallest to 0
since the remainder in this case equals 0, we exit the loop and return the largest number as an answer

    }

    return largest
};
