We then loop through that object and count how many time a student has been absent (a number of times letter "A" occurs in the object ) as well as how many time a studen has been late (a number of time a letter "L" occurs in the object). If the number of times A occur is less than 2 and letter L occurs less than or equal to 3, we return true. Otherwise, we return false
