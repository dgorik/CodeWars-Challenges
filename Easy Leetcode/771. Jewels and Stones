You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

/**
 * @param {string} jewels
 * @param {string} stones
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    const map = {}

    var count = 0

    for(var jewel of jewels){
        map[jewel] = true
    }

    for(var stone of stones){
        if(map[stone]){
            count++
        }
    }

    return count
};
