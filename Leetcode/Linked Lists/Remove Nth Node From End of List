//The general idea is that you set up two pointers: one fast and one slow.
//You move the fast pointers to n+1 positon
//You then move the slow and right pointers untill right is not null
//The positon of a slow pointer will be a node before the one we need to remove so you can remove the node by writing slow.next = slow.next.next
