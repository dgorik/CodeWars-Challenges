// The idea here is to create a map to store copies of each node. You can then use that map to set up pointers by looking at what original nodes are pointing to. 
- {cur: copy}
copy.next equals to what cur.next is pointing to. If it points to null, we set copy.next to null
copy.random equals to what cur.next is pointing to. If it points to null, we set copy.random to null
