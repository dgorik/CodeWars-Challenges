//The idea here is to create a monotonic stack and add elements to the stack until we reach an element that is not smaller than the last element in the stack
// We add an element (temperature) and its index to the stack

//When we find an element that is bigger than the top element of the stack, we pop the top element in the stack and set a element at StackInd to a difference between i (an index of the element we are looping through) and StackInd
