 //PREP

 //A function that will always accept an integer. I assume no floats will be given

 //This function will also return an integer. The returned integer will be reversed

 //the example would be: we are given an integer 123, and the function should return an answer 321

 //the pseudocode code:
 //let's check if x has any zeros at the end. If it does, we should remove those zeros and reverse the number that comes before the last zero at the end
 //in order to reverse a number, we can convert it to a string, reverse a string and then convert that string back to a number
 // we should also extract a sign before the conversion
 //before submitting the answer, we should check if the answer falls outside the range of [-231, 231 - 1]. If it does, return 0 and if it doesn't, return the answer itself.

var reverse = function(x) {

    if( x == 0 ) return 0

    while(x % 10 == 0){
        x = x/10
    }

    let sign = Math.sign(x)

    x = sign * parseInt(x.toString().split('').reverse().join(''))

    return x < Math.pow(-2, 31) || x > Math.pow(2, 31) - 1 ? 0: x
};
