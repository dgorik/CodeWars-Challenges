/**
 * Finds the missing element between two arrays.
 *
 * This function takes two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, and assumes that `arr2`
 * is a copy of `arr1` with exactly one element missing. The function calculates
 * the missing element by finding the difference between the sums of the two arrays.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr1 - The original array.
 * @param {number[]} arr2 - The array with one element missing.
 * @returns {number} The missing element.
